# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. This file covers the dev loop, conventions, and what to check before you open a PR.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgeislands/mcp-m365.git
cd mcp-m365
npm install
```

`npm install` triggers `prepare` which configures the husky pre-commit hook — so every commit will auto-run `lint-staged` and format your changes.

## Dev loop

```bash
npm run dev:mcp           # tsx watch — runs the server from source
npm run inspect           # MCP Inspector against the TS source
npm run typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
npm run test              # vitest
npm run test:watch        # vitest in watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # vitest with v8 coverage report
npm run lint:check        # Biome lint + format check
npm run lint:fix          # Biome auto-fix
npm run lint:md           # prettier + markdownlint for *.md
```

## Conventions

### Code

- **TypeScript ES modules** — `"type": "module"`, internal imports use `.js` extensions (e.g. `from './tools/calendar/list.js'`) so `tsc` emits valid JS.
- **Arrow functions** for top-level declarations (`export const foo = () => …`).
- **Strict path safety**: any tool input that touches the filesystem must go through `resolveWithinRoot(ROOT_PATH, …)` from `src/utils.ts`. Inputs that resolve outside the root throw `Path escapes root`.
- **Errors**: tools return MCP errors via `errorResult(...)`; structured results via `jsonResult(...)`.
- **Annotations**: be honest with `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint` on every tool registration.

### Commits

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) so [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) can derive version bumps and changelog entries automatically.

| Type        | What it means           | Bumps |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| `feat:`     | new feature             | minor |
| `fix:`      | bug fix                 | patch |
| `perf:`     | performance improvement | patch |
| `docs:`     | documentation only      | patch |
| `deps:`     | dependency change       | patch |
| `refactor:` | internal restructuring  | none  |
| `test:`     | test-only changes       | none  |
| `chore:`    | tooling, config         | none  |
| `build:`    | build pipeline          | none  |
| `ci:`       | CI changes              | none  |

Add `!` for breaking changes (`feat!:` / `fix!:`) — bumps major.

### Testing

- New code should ship with tests. Vitest is configured with V8 coverage and has thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` — if your change drops coverage below the threshold, CI fails.
- File-level isolation: tests share `ROOT_PATH` (set to a tmpdir in `vitest.config.ts`), so tests should clean up after themselves with `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.

## Before opening a PR

- [ ] `npm run lint:check` passes
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `npm run test:coverage` passes (no threshold failures)
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] If you added/removed/renamed a tool, update `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`

CI runs all of the above on every PR.
